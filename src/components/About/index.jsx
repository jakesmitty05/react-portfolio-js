        I am Jacob Smith, a 18 year old high school graduate with a passion for web development. I recently graduated from Michigan State University Coding Bootcamp, and have been working in the food service industry for about a year at Greenfield Village. Throughout high school, I was a part of the environmental club and played soccer and was a diver for the swim team. I have always had an interest in computer science and coding, and am excited to start my career looking towards a future in web development.
